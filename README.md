interface design assignment four

This assignment is about making a summer holiday adventure website without using CSS-frameworks. The adventure concept of the website is mountain biking.

Unlike previous projects I have used Gulp in this project for managing tasks and Susy for managing grids in a flexible way.
The page is a one-pager with a background video which is also something I haven't made before.
